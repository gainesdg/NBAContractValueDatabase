# NBA Contract Value Database

# Introduction 

Every year when the NBA's most valuable player award is given out, there is alyways much debate over who truly is the most valuable player in the league. This discourse has always been very entriguing to me, so I decided to take my love of Computer Science and data analysis to see if I could combine these facets to find the statistically most valuable player in the league for the 2019 - 2020 season. I knew from the start this wouldn't give the exact answer of the "most valuable" player in the league, but I thought it would be interesting to see if this could uncover any underrated role players in the league. I felt that this would be an interesting project to combine with my newfound interest in databasing, so I therefore decided to use that as the framework to solve this problem.

# Data Collection and Curation

I used Basketball Reference's salary and stat information to collect all of the data I needed for this database. However before I was to collect player data, I was going to need to decide statistic minimums for players I was going to use for this study. After some research and discussion with others, I decided the statistical mininum I was going to use was 10 games played and 10 minutes per game played. I belive that these minimums would remove players harshly affected by injury and those who might of had inflated stats due to playing in garbage time. With the list of players meeting these statistical minimums now solidified, I moved on to what statistics I would collect for each player. The statistcs I therefore decided on were: team, salary, rookie scale contract status, VORP, and Win Shares. I believe that the team and salary statistics are pretty self explanatory, team is a very nice label to have in possinle future uses of this database and if we are going to find the NBA player with the most valuable salary, we do in fact need the salary. The first interesting point of data I believe I collected was in fact whether or not the player was on a rookie scale contract. For those who are unfamiliar, when an NBA player is selected in the first round of the NBA draft their contract is pretty set in stone by a pre-determined rookie scale based on the pick they were selected at. I knew that if I didn't due something to at least mark these players, the top of the list would be dominated by young starts like Jayson Tatum, Luka Doncic, and Trae Young, who have not been able to negoiate their first contract yet, and my focus was more to look at smart contracts than good draft picks by teams. However they deifnitey should still be included in this study in some capacity, so I decided to have each player have a data point of either "Yes" or "No" marking whether or not they were on a rookie scale contract, allowing me to toggle including them in queries I made on the database. Then we come to the final statistics I collected for each player, VORP and Win Shares. Both of these stats are advanced metrics that are used to measure different contributions players make to a team, and both have their various pros and cons, so I wanted to go with a two pronged approach. VORP stands for Value Over Replacement Player which measures the value that a player has over an average zero value player and is calculated using the box score +/- over the course of a season. While in my opinion VORP is the best advanced statsitic to measure NBA success, I feel that the box score +/- the statistic is based on doesn't really measure the winning and hustle certain players like Marcus Smart bring, which is why I also wanted to add in Win Shares. Win Shares is the amount of wins a specific player ended up bringing to a team that season, and therefore measures how much value a player contributes to winning. However, the biggest drawback with this statistic in my opinion, is that this stat overvalues bad/average players on good teams and over punishes good players on bad teams. However, I feel that overall both of these staistics cover the weaknesses of the other. However when looking at the data and how it would be implemented, I quickly came to realize that there would be two problems. The first of these is issues with the number zero. While I will get deeper into my algorithm when I dive into that section later on, I will give context that at its core the formula is (advanced statistic)/(salary). Then, say hypothetically that we have Player A making 5 million dollars with a VORP of 0 and Player B making 30 million dollars with a VORP of 0. Using the previous formula, the result would be 0 for both, however it is clear that the player making 5 million is quite a bit more valuable than the one making 30 million. The second problem comes with advanced metric values that are negative. Since we will be combing the results from two statistics
